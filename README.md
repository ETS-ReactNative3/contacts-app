# Overview

This is a simple contacts mobile application, which I developed to learn more about React Native and NodeJS.

This application was developed for educational purposes and should not be used due to security breaches.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a package manager, Expo and NodeJS.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository ```git clone https://github.com/gmtavora/contacts-app/```
2. In ```mobile```, install the needed packages using your package manager.
3. In the backend folder, you may need to fill the database with some fake contacts using ```node fillDatabase.js```
4. Run the server ```node index.js```
5. Run the application using Expo or your preferred simulator.

## Tests
